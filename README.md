# Dot-and-Box-Game
Create a reinforcement learning agent for dot and box games (2x2 grid) in matlab.
Can play against a random computer opponent to learn.
Also can learn by playing against a human opponent.
Action(Q) values are saved in a .mat file which can be used as the trained status of the agent.
State space is reduced by considering symmetry in the 2x2 grid.
